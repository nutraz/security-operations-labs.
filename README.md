This repository contains structured notes, playbooks, and practical walkthroughs related to **Security Operations (SOC)**, **Threat Intelligence**, and **Incident Response**.

The purpose of this repository is to document hands-on learning, analytical workflows, and security operations thinking through realistic, scenario-based examples. It demonstrates how security alerts are analyzed, incidents are handled, and threats are mapped and documented in operational environments.

This is a **living repository** and will be continuously updated as new tools, techniques, and scenarios are explored.
