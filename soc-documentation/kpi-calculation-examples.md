# KPI Calculation Examples

---

### Introduction

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential for measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of a Security Operations Center (SOC). This document provides practical examples of how to calculate common SOC KPIs, using hypothetical data. For a broader overview of SOC metrics, refer to `soc-documentation/soc-metrics-documentation.md`.

### 1. Alert Volume and True/False Positive Rates

These metrics help assess the noise level in a SOC and the accuracy of its detection mechanisms.

#### 1.1. Total Alerts Generated

-   **Definition:** The total number of alerts generated by all security tools (SIEM, EDR, IDS/IPS, etc.) within a given period.
-   **Calculation:** Sum of all alerts.
-   **Example:**
    -   Month: January 2026
    -   SIEM Alerts: 15,000
    -   EDR Alerts: 8,000
    -   IDS/IPS Alerts: 2,000
    -   **Total Alerts Generated = 15,000 + 8,000 + 2,000 = 25,000**

#### 1.2. False Positive Rate (FPR)

-   **Definition:** The percentage of alerts that are investigated and determined to be benign or non-malicious.
-   **Calculation:** `(Number of False Positives / Total Number of Alerts) * 100`
-   **Example (continuing from above):**
    -   Total Alerts Generated: 25,000
    -   Alerts Triaged as False Positives: 18,750
    -   **FPR = (18,750 / 25,000) * 100 = 75%** (A high FPR indicates a need for tuning detection rules or adjusting alert thresholds.)

#### 1.3. True Positive Rate (TPR) / Detection Rate

-   **Definition:** The percentage of alerts that are investigated and confirmed to be actual security incidents.
-   **Calculation:** `(Number of True Positives / Total Number of Alerts) * 100` (Note: This is an alert-level TPR. Incident-level TPR would be different.)
-   **Example:**
    -   Total Alerts Generated: 25,000
    -   Alerts Triaged as True Positives: 6,250
    -   **TPR = (6,250 / 25,000) * 100 = 25%**

### 2. Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)

MTTD is a critical metric measuring how long it takes the SOC to identify a security incident from the moment it actually occurs.

-   **Definition:** The average time from the start of an incident to its detection by the SOC.
-   **Calculation:** `Sum of (Detection Time - Incident Start Time) for all incidents / Total Number of Incidents`
-   **Example:**
    -   **Incident 1:**
        -   Incident Start Time: 2026-01-05 10:00:00
        -   Detection Time: 2026-01-05 10:15:00
        -   Detection Duration: 15 minutes
    -   **Incident 2:**
        -   Incident Start Time: 2026-01-10 08:30:00
        -   Detection Time: 2026-01-10 09:00:00
        -   Detection Duration: 30 minutes
    -   **Incident 3:**
        -   Incident Start Time: 2026-01-15 14:00:00
        -   Detection Time: 2026-01-15 14:05:00
        -   Detection Duration: 5 minutes
    -   **MTTD = (15 + 30 + 5) / 3 = 50 / 3 = 16.67 minutes**

### 3. Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)

MTTR measures the efficiency of the SOC in handling and resolving incidents after they have been detected. It often includes Mean Time to Contain (MTTC) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR - here meaning full resolution).

#### 3.1. Mean Time to Contain (MTTC)

-   **Definition:** The average time from detection of an incident to its containment.
-   **Calculation:** `Sum of (Containment Time - Detection Time) for all incidents / Total Number of Incidents`
-   **Example (continuing Incident 1, 2, 3):**
    -   **Incident 1:**
        -   Detection Time: 2026-01-05 10:15:00
        -   Containment Time: 2026-01-05 10:45:00
        -   Containment Duration: 30 minutes
    -   **Incident 2:**
        -   Detection Time: 2026-01-10 09:00:00
        -   Containment Time: 2026-01-10 11:30:00
        -   Containment Duration: 150 minutes
    -   **Incident 3:**
        -   Detection Time: 2026-01-15 14:05:00
        -   Containment Time: 2026-01-15 14:35:00
        -   Containment Duration: 30 minutes
    -   **MTTC = (30 + 150 + 30) / 3 = 210 / 3 = 70 minutes**

#### 3.2. Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)

-   **Definition:** The average time from detection of an incident to its full resolution (including eradication and recovery).
-   **Calculation:** `Sum of (Resolution Time - Detection Time) for all incidents / Total Number of Incidents`
-   **Example (continuing Incident 1, 2, 3):**
    -   **Incident 1:**
        -   Detection Time: 2026-01-05 10:15:00
        -   Resolution Time: 2026-01-05 12:15:00
        -   Resolution Duration: 120 minutes
    -   **Incident 2:**
        -   Detection Time: 2026-01-10 09:00:00
        -   Resolution Time: 2026-01-10 15:00:00
        -   Resolution Duration: 360 minutes
    -   **Incident 3:**
        -   Detection Time: 2026-01-15 14:05:00
        -   Resolution Time: 2026-01-15 15:05:00
        -   Resolution Duration: 60 minutes
    -   **MTTR = (120 + 360 + 60) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180 minutes (3 hours)**

### 4. Incident Backlog

-   **Definition:** The number of open incidents that are awaiting investigation or resolution at a given point in time.
-   **Calculation:** Count of incidents with "Open" or "Pending" status.
-   **Example:** On 2026-01-31, there are 15 high-severity and 30 medium-severity incidents in the queue.
    -   **Incident Backlog = 45**
